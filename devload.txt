    DEVLOAD 3.25 USER GUIDE
    -----------------------

    DEVLOAD is an utility for loading device drivers from command line.
    It supports FAT16 and FAT32 block device drivers (e.g. DI1000DD.SYS
    and ASPIDISK.SYS), COM and EXE - style DOS device drivers and has a
    very compact binary file (less than 3KiB).

    Usage
    -----

    Usage:    DEVLOAD [switches] filename [params]
    Emulates: DEVICE=filename [params] in CONFIG.SYS

    Switches:

      /? - display help message.
      /H - try to load driver to UMB.
           (equivalent of DEVICEHIGH=filename [params] in CONFIG.SYS)
      /Q - quiet mode.
      /V - verbose mode.
      /A - auto-mode (force to stay loaded).
      /D - drive letter, eg. /DS installs to S: or later.

    Explanations:

      If no filename is given or if the /? option is given, DEVLOAD
      shows a help message. The /Q mode makes DEVLOAD show fewer
      messages than usual (only warnings) while /V makes it show
      more messages, including technical and memory usage details.

      The /A option bypasses the "driver wants to stay in RAM but
      hooks no interrupts and provides no block nor char devices,
      keep it in RAM anyway?" question by always assuming that the
      answer is yes. Only very few drivers are affected by this.

      With the /H option, DEVLOAD will try to behave like DEVICEHIGH
      and load your driver into UMB. If you have no UMB of sufficient
      size (at least file size or, if exe header present, load size
      plus minimum heap according to the exe header), the driver will
      be loaded into low RAM as if you had not used the /H option.

      Note that your driver may say that your UMB is too small even
      if DEVLOAD thinks it is sufficient. Then your driver will not
      load and you will have to load without the /H option instead.
      
      The /D option is used to indicate the drive letter to use.
      If the requested drive is in use then subsequent drive letters
      until LASTDRIVE is reached are tried.  The default value is 
      equivalent to /DC, i.e. C: or later - the first available 
      drive letter.

      On successful loading the exit code (ERRORLEVEL) will be set
      to a value between 0 and 26, where 0 is returned for character
      devices and for block devices the first assigned drive is
      returned (where 1=A:, 2=B:, 3=C:, ... 26=Z:).  On any error
      or is device is not loaded then 255 is returned.  [Future
      versions may provide unique values depending on the error.]
      is returned as the exit code, where A:=0, ... Z:=25.  

    Examples:

      1) USBASPI from command line
         DEVLOAD /H USBASPI.SYS /V /W
         DEVLOAD /H DI1000DD.SYS

      2) ASPI driver for IDE (e.g. for CDRTOOLS)
         DEVLOAD ASPI.SYS

    System requirements
    -------------------

    * DOS 3.00 and higher
    * Intel 8086 CPU, 640KiB of RAM

      FreeDOS 1.0 or EDR-DOS WIP 17.6.2007+
      for FAT32 block device drivers support
    
    WARNING: DEVLOAD cannot load FAT32 block device drivers under PTS-DOS 32!
